# Misc

## Subpixel and accelerated positioning

Instead of `top{:.objectKey}` and `left{:.objectKey}` as shown
throughout the docs, you can use `transform: translate(){:sass}`
instead to position the floating element for increased
performance.

```js
Object.assign(floatingEl.style, {
  top: '0',
  left: '0',
  transform: `translate(${Math.round(x)}px,${Math.round(y)}px)`,
});
```

`x` and `y` can contain decimals, so unless the
`transform{:.objectKey}` translation is placed evenly on the
device's subpixel grid, then there will be blurring. You can
check `window.devicePixelRatio{:js}` to round by DPR.

### 3D transforms

You can also promote the floating element to its own layer:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
Object.assign(floatingEl.style, {
  top: '0',
  left: '0',
  transform: `translate3d(${Math.round(x)}px,${Math.round(y)}px,0)`,
});
```

If you're animating the location of the floating element, using
`transform{:.objectKey}` will offer smoother animations.

## z-index stacking and clipping

Floating UI does not have opinions about how your elements stack
on the z-axis. This means your element may be occluded beneath
another positioned element if it has a higher `z-index`.

Further, you may find your floating element is being clipped by
its parent. `computePosition(){:js}` attempts to keep the
floating element in view as best as possible in this scenario but
in some cases this cannot be avoided.

- Using the `'fixed'{:js}` strategy will "break" the floating
  element out of its parent clipping context in the majority of
  cases. This allows you to keep the floating element's DOM
  context in tact.
- The floating element can be appended to a root ancestor node
  inside `<body>{:html}`, e.g.
  `<div id="floating-root"></div>{:html}` (also referred to as
  "portalling")

In the future, Floating UI may
[enable you to specify elements to avoid](https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui/issues/1440),
so multiple floating elements can avoid colliding with each other
intelligently without worrying about their `z-index`.

## Handling large content

When your floating element's width exceeds the viewport's, it can
result in unexpected behavior.

You can limit the width of the floating element using the
following CSS:

```css
.floating {
  max-width: calc(100vw - 10px);
}
```

This will always make it 10 pixels less than the width of the
viewport.

The constant `10{:js}` shown in the example should be double the
`padding{:.objectKey}` given to the `shift(){:js}` middleware if
it's in use.

Alternatively, you may experiment with the [size](/docs/size)
middleware depending on the axis overflow is occurring.
